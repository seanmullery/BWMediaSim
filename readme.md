# Simulation of Black and White Media from RGB

This method will create a simulated Black and White image for any media for which
the Spectral response is known.

If you have a spectral response that is not included in the list, you can add it
to the either the LvsFilm.csv or LvsTube.csv, for Film and TV tube responses respectively

Then follow the format in the simulateBWMedia.py to output a file with that simulation.

For explanation of the process please read chapter five of the PhD Thesis [Rethinking auto-colourisation of natural Images in the context of deep learning.](https://doras.dcu.ie/28111/)
